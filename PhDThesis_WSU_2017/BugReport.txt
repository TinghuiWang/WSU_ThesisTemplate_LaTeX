Removal of dedication causes chapter numbers to be incorrect
    Moved \setcounter to \setupThesisStyle

Removing unnecessary packages:
    babel
    csquotes
    subfig => subcaption


Appendix figure labels formatted with a 0 section
    Added lines in "main_thesis.tex" which change the appendix
    figure labels. The counter must be reset to zero before each
    additional appendix.

Line break in 'title' definition won't compile
    Change linebreak command to \protect\\
    Note added in template to indicate this fix
